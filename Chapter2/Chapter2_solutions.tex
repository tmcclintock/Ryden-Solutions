\section{Exercise 1}
\label{sec:ex1}

We want to calculate the mean free path $l$ of an arrow fired in a forest, where the trees have radius $R$ and the average number of trees per unit area is $\Sigma$. Thinking about scaling, if the trees were more tightly packed, then $l$ should decrease, so then $l$ should be inversely proportional to $\Sigma$. Similarly, if the trees are larger the arrow will not travel as far, so $l$ should be inversely proportional to $R$. Thus, the solution is $l=(R\Sigma)^{-1}$. Given that $R=1$ m and $\Sigma = 0.005$ m$^{-2}$, this means $l=200$ m. {\it Note} this answer isn't perfect, because the trees protrude forward toward the path of the arrow, but computing this correction is tricky because it involves an integral over the impact parameter $b$ of the arrow with respect to the tree it hits. To a first approximation, the true answer is somewhere between 199 m and 200 m.

\section{Exercise 2}
\label{sec:ex2}

This problem is identical to Exercise 1 but in three dimensions. The number density of stars is given by $n_*$, and the average stellar radius is $R_*$, meaning the cross-sectional area is $\sigma = 4\pi R_*^2$. The mean free path is again inversely proportional to $n_*$ and $\sigma$, so $l=(\sigma n_*)^{-1}$. Given that $n_* = 10^9$ Mpc$^{-3}$ and $R_* = 7\times 10^8$ m, this means $l = 2.1\times 10^{17}$ Mpc.

Similarly, if galaxies are spaced according to $n_g= 1$ Mpc$^{-3}$ and $R_g=2000$ pc, then the mean free path to hit a galaxy is $l_g = 20000$ Mpc. We see that a photon is fairly likely to pass through a galaxy, but not necessarily hit a star in that galaxy.
